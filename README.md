# Python-Exercises
This is a repository for all the Python exercises, which I've done
in order to learn the language. Some of the topics are variables,
loops, functions, string manipulations, lists, dictionaries, 
stacks, queues, tuples, sets, multidimensional lists, comprehensions,
error handling, classes, instances, methods, encapsulation, 
inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, iterators, generators and
decorators.
